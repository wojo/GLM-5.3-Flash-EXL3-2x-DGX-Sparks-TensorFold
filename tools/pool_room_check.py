"""Checks for patch 0074 (the shared pool compacts before it evicts), run inside the image that scripts/prepare.sh
built:

MultiDecoder's room-making (_grow, _room) on the real Pool and a CPU arena, no GPU or model: a conversation whose
extent cannot grow in place and a new request, each while the pool's free rows cover them in several ranges (nothing
evicted, every kept prompt's rows intact, each extent moved once at most, rank 1 replaying the ops to the same
extents and rows), the same for a decoding stream's extent, too few free rows (only the least recently used state it
needs evicted), and protected extents. Exit code 1 when a check fails.
